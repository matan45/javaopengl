exception handling (builder or factory)// massages box

macro record  
UI system+layers // 2 scroll bar and radio button and textbox and need to do hash map for the gui handler plos need to get the texture Width, Height 
settings files

need to add raycast to entity colliders there is only on the terrain
physics (gravite, terrain test) //player collision move
//need to test the gjk 3D
//no collision on rotation aabb need to implement Separating Axis Theorem for 3d
//need to define velocity on the entities and only the physics check collision
//aabb rotation is working but need the 4 corners to make it accurate and need to pass the rotation on the update method
//need to add id to collider
optimization // use Profiling
level generator 
FBO common class
AI //need to map the terrain for walkable layer nav agent and to path finding Astar or Bfs
//need to add path finding algorithm
objloader for normal and specular maps no need different loaders
terrain for detection slop on a player preplayer position and current position need to work on it for 3d space
light need to do directions and distance 
light add radius

3D:
day and night system //have time system just need to update you sky box and print to the gui text
fog//need to add uniform variables for the const 
input text //need to change the const to uniform
shadow // add shadow to normal and entity like the terrain and optimize it
material
water system //need to optimize it
animation need to add 3rd camera and switch animation 
//need to abstract the animation from the animation project

weather system (rain ,snow)//extend particle system
terrain // need to do common abstract class, need to add normals maps like entity 
terrain editor //mabe?
clouds 
entity //need to add specular maps to the normal entity 
add cube map reflection

need to refactoring the shaders class
